We demonstrated how to predict US inflation using three different models: Linear Regression model, Long-memory Process, ARIMA seasonal models. 
Firstly, a linear regression model AIC test indicates that model with 2 predicting variables oil_diff and CPI_diff is the best to predict the Inflation_diff.
Secondly, a long-memory and seasonal ARIMA models plot predictions for the next eight quarters. A significant observation on the log model predicts larger numbers with a larger confidence interval.
